-- DATA STRUCTURES --
  1. Storing variable definitions
    - dictionary (variable name : [argument, definition])
    {string var : (string arg, string definition) ]}

  2. Storing facts in the system
    - dictionary (variable name : index to rule)
    {string var : int index, ...}

  3. List of rules
    - going to have to be able to look up all the rules that contain the variable
    - can keep track of what rules led to the fact being true
    - list of true rules
    [(string expr, string var), ...]

-- IMPLEMENTING LEARN --
Forward chaining: apply rules --> facts
Make new facts
Add facts to the dictionary with the index of the last rule that led them to be true

Not A -> B

ALGORITHM:
  Loop through each rule
  If new fact is learned:
    Add fact to (dict) facts with index to rule you last learned it from
    Loop through each rule again
  Else:
    End learn

HARD POINTS:
- Evaluating the expression
  order of operations: Not, And, Or
  parentheses

    - Scan through the entire expression; look for the least used expression
